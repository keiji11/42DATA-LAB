Create a file called "intern.py". Then create a Intern class
containing the following functionalities:
A builder taking a character chain as a parameter, assigning
its value to a Name attribute. "My name? I’m nobody, an
intern, I have no name." will be implemented as default
value.
A method __str__() that will return Name attribute of the
instance.
A Coffee class with a simple __str__() method that will
return the character chain "This is the worst coffee you ever
tasted.".
A work() method that will raise only one exception (use the
basic (Exception) type)
with the text "I’m just an intern, I can’t do that...".
A make_coffee() method that will return an instance of the
Coffee class that you will have implemented in Intern class.
In your tests, you will have to instantiate twice the Intern
class. Once without a name, the second time with the name
"Mark".
Display the name of each instance. Ask mark to make you a
coffee and display the result. Ask the other intern to work.
You will have to manage the exception in your test.
