Create a file called beverages.py. Inside create a
HotBeverage class with the following functionalities:
- A price attribute with the value of 0.30
- A name attribute with the "hot beverage" value
- A description() method returning an instance description.
The description value will be "Just some hot water in a
cup".
-A __str__() method returning an instance description in
this form
name : <name attribute>
price : <price attribute limited to two decimal points>
description : <instance's description>
for instance, a HotBeverage instance display would look
like this:
name : hot beverage
price : 0.30
description : Just some hot water in a cup.
Then create the following derived classes from
HotBeverage:
- Coffee:
name: "coffee"
price: 0.40
description: "A coffee, to stay awake."
- Tea:
name: "tea"
price: 0.30
description: "Just some hot water in a cup."
- Chocolate:
name: "chocolate"
price: 0.50
description: "Chocolate, sweet chocolate..."
- Cappuccino:
name: "cappuccino"
price: 0.45
description: "Un po' di Italia nella sua tazza!"
In your tests, instantiate each class among: HotBeverage,
Coffee, Tea, Chocolate and Cappuccino and display them.
